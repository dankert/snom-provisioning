# SNOM Phone provisioning

Snom phones can be provisioned by a custom settings url.

This script is able to provision
- the network configuration
- the phonebook

All phones are configured in a simple YAML file.
The phonebook is read from a CSV file. The CSV file format is the google contacs CSV file format. So you can provision your phonebook with your google contacts.

Provisioning of user accounts is not implemented yet, but planned ;)
